## Cloth Diapers

There are many sections that need to be written up in this document, but I'll
start by writing up the critical sections required for basic knowledge
or those that I have a specific opinion about.

_Disclaimer_: These are my personal opinions and as such, don't come at me if
yours are different!

However, the plan is to include the following
+ Nomenclature (multiple languages)
+ [Types of Cloth Diapers](#types-of-cloth-diapers)
+ [Materials and Absorbency](#materials-and-absorbency)
+ [Newborn vs One Size](#newborn-vs-one-size)
+ Velcro vs Poppers
+ [Our Choices](#our-choices)
+ Things to Know
+ What causes leaks

## Types of Cloth Diapers

I don't want to go into all the different types of cloth diaper just yet as
there are actually a lot of decent resources online already on this, such as
https://www.thenappygurus.com/types-of-cloth-nappies.html

The whole of the [Nappy Gurus Help & Advice](https://www.thenappygurus.com/help.html)
section is extremely well put together and very helfpul if you're starting out.

I'm just leaving this diagram here as a reference point to discuss the
choices we have made (see below).

## Materials and Absorbency

<img width="664" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4185328/169095781-8c3c8f69-3ae5-4e04-ab39-780f198651a5.png">

Cloth diapers hinge on both their speed of and capacity for absorbency.

The only other thing to mention other than the table above is 'Charcoal Bamboo'.
This is actually not bamboo at all, it's just a fancy name for microfibre and
equally unhelpful.

### Absorbency capacity
The more capacity for absorbency, the more liquid a diaper will hold.

Having said this, every baby is different so whilst some can get away with
very little absorbency, others are considered 'medium to heavy wetters' and
will need a lot more absorbency, relying much more heavily on hemp inserts
(typically used in pocket diapers) or boosters (typically layered into other
types of diapers to increase absorbency).

### Absorbency speed
This is important for two reasons:
1. You need to layer your absorbency so that the layers closer to the baby
are the ones that absorb liquids the fastest - this will allow that layer to
absorb the liquids and wick them away to the lower layers which will have more
storage capacity.
2. If you have a baby who 'floods'; i.e. releases a large quantity of liquid
in a short time frame. Here you want the fastest possible absorption to wick
away the moisture so that you don't get leaks.

## Newborn vs One Size
There are 3 'sizes' of cloth diapers:
+ **Newborn**: These are extra small diapers that in some cases (not all) also
fit preemies. They have snaps that allow them to be resized to 2 or 3 different
sizes as well.
+ **One Size:** Often referred to as ***OS*** diapers, these are the typical
size of modern cloth diaper that **will accompany a child throughout the
majority of their diaper journey**. They are marketed as fitting babies from
around 3-15kg (with a small amount of variation per brand) but usually don't fit
newborns because the leg holes are designed for slightly bigger babies.
+ **XL:** Nomenclature varies but these are often designated 'XL' or 'Super'
and are made for older toddlers but sizes vary widely. They could refer to
diapers that are 9 - 18kgs for example or even diapers that are 15 - 20kgs, so
it's important to review the stipulations of fit from the individual brand.

**One size (OS) are by _far_ the most common**, with many people deciding to
wait until their babies fit into this size before they start their cloth diaper
journey.

There _are_ 'newborn hacks' of folds that allow you to use OS diapers on smaller
babies but these are greatly dependent on the baby's body and on the diaper
brands.

# Our Choices

Our choices have evolved over time, not only as we have gained experience
but also as little A has grown and had different requirements.

## Diaper Sizes
I chose to invest in a small stash of newborn cloth diapers because I wanted
to start as soon as possible. I wanted to learn the systems and understand
what we preferred to use _before_ buying a full stash of OS diapers that we
might hate because they were the wrong type or materials.

Unless you don't plan to start cloth diapering until baby is 3 months old or
so, I think this is a good investment because it lets you learn the ropes and
they hold their value extremely well (more so than OS) so can be sold on easily.


## Diaper Types
Now that we have 'dialed things in' a little more, there are three types of
diapers we use (there are others, but these are the only 3 in our rotation):

### 1. All-In-Ones (AIO)
This is our 'favourite' kind of diaper because it requires the **_least_ time
to put together** by _far_. For the majority you just have to push the 'tongue'
(sewn in insert) back into the pocket and that's it.
With a small number (in our stash it's the Motherease Wizard Unos and
Bellz Bumz Reusabelles), they're ready to go straight off the line.

Whilst we now find we have to reinforce the majority of these with an extra
3 layer bamboo insert, this isn't the case with all of them.

**The biggest issue with AIOs** is that they take a lot longer to dry.

**The key thing to be aware of** is that not all AIOs are created equally
in terms of absorption. It is _very important_ to understand what the material
composition of these diapers is so that you know what you're dealing with.

For example:
[Modern Cloth Nappies AIOs](https://www.modernclothnappies.co.uk/collections/pearl-pocket-all-in-one-nappies/products/pearl-pocket-all-in-one-reusable-one-size-nappy)
(my absolute favourite AIOs from our stash), have a super absorbent
hemp cotton mix insert.

The [Bambino Miosolo AIOs](https://www.bambinomio.com/collections/miosolo/products/miosolo-diaper)
sit at the complete opposite end of that scale, with a microfibre core which,
despite the claims on the website of 'super absorbency', has _very little
absorbency_ and _very good marketing_.

I wouldn't risk using one of these without reinforcement at any time of day.
Why do we still have them you ask? Because they have a _great_ fit and are
very practical in that sense!

### 2. Pocket Diapers
We started using One Size diapers in the Spring and AIOs were a firm favourite
because as I mentioned, the gave me very little work to put together.

But then Winter came [insert your favourite Game of Thrones meme here].

I struggled to get anything to dry, even with a dehumidifier on constantly.
So we moved to pocket diapers for Winter.

They take a LOT more time to put together but the shells air dry very quickly
and if you're desperate you can throw the inserts in the tumble dryer too.

We use _high quality_ natural material inserts.

Our ***hemp inserts*** are triple layer hemp/cotton inserts with a _high_ percentage
of hemp (55% hemp, 45% cotton): https://www.eco-tiny.com/product/absorvente-de-canhamo-e-algodao-organico-ecotiny

Our ***bamboo inserts*** are 100% bamboo
[Little Lamb bamboo doublers](https://littlelamb.com/products/bamboo-booster-doubler).

Our infallible inserts combinations here are:
+ Morning diapers: 2 hemp inserts + 1 bamboo doubler folded in half (giving
us 4 layers of bamboo booster) in the front of the diaper
+ Afternoon diapers: 1 hemp insert + 1 bamboo doubler folded in half (giving
us 4 layers of bamboo booster) in the front of the diaper

> We use our pockets throughout the Winter (with AIOs filling in the gaps)
and whenever we are travelling for ease of washing and drying.


### 3. Fitted diapers with covers (night time)
For night time we use fitted diapers which are made entirely of absorbent material
(in our case usually 100% bamboo or a bamboo/hemp mix), reinforced
with hemp or bamboo inserts and covered with a PUL cover or wrap to make them
leak proof.

We wipe down the PUL cover in the mornings and it can be reused 3 times
before needing to be washed (if baby is teething, the smells are often
stronger so we wash as needed).

We use these because:
+ We don't change diapers overnight because baby no longer :poop: and it
would be worse to wake him for a diaper change
+ We need much more absorbency because of this - we could never get away
with using a pocket overnight because we wouldn't be able to add enough
absorbency (but a lot of people can, this depends on the baby)
+ We use hemp reinforcements because we don't have flooding (large amounts of
liquid in a short space of time) so the slow
absorption of hemp is fine for us
  + If we needed to account for flooding I would test adding a cotton layer
  between the baby and the hemp insert


## Considerations

### Morning vs Afternoons
Babies will not have the same absorption needs all day or even all year round.
Here, we require a lot more absorption in the mornings (until just after lunch)
than in the afternoons.

We have solved this pretty simply by splitting the diaper storage into a
morning section an afternoon section, where we keep the diapers that have
less absorption.

### Diaper Types I dislike

+ **Flats and prefolds + wrap:** I don't have the patience or the inclination to fold
flats and I have not had enough practice to be successful at making these leak
proof (google 'jelly rolls' in relation to diapers if you're using flats and
want to understand how best to adjust the legs). I always found they were too
finnicky and took too long with a fussy newborn.
  + Note that many _many_ people swear by flats and prefolds as the only
  thing that can contain newborn :poop: explosions - I fully believe this _if_
  you can get your head around how to put them on correct.
+ **All-In-Twos (AI2s):** I have nothing against the diapers themselves (they
do dry a lot faster than AIOs because they completely come apart), but putting them
together is Hellish. Each brand of AI2 has specific inserts that snap into them
so you either have to commit to one brand or you have to keep hunting for the
right inserts. Snaps are often different across diaper brands too, not to mention
the fit of the inserts inside the shell. It makes the whole exercise both a pain
and difficult to be picked up by anyone else.
  + I should note that the supposed advantage of AI2s is that when you change
  the diaper you can theoretically snap out the inserts, wipe off the shell and
  then reuse that shell with fresh inserts, making them great for limited
  space and holiday stashes that dry quickly. But in practice, quite a few
  AI2 shells can't be reused as is the case with the wildly popular
  [Close Pop-In](https://closeparent.com/collections/birth-to-potty-nappies/products/single-printed-nappy-bamboo-puffin-bio-laminate)
  diapers that have an fleece section in the shell which is impossible to
  clean between changes
+ **AI2s masquerading as AIOs:** There are plenty of diaper brands that have
'AIO' diapers that are in reality, as far as I can see, AI2s. They have snap-in
inserts that are particular to that diaper such as the Petite Crown Trima below.
  + The advantage is that Yes, they dry faster. But this also defeats the
  purpose of an AIO.

### Exceptions to the (my) Rules
#### AI2s
Although I really don't like AI2s, there is one kind that made it into our
stash that I have not sold on and will not be selling: Close Pop-in AI2s.

Let me be clear: these are possibly the _most_ annoying AI2s on the market.
Putting them together is a total nightmare of tiny poppers that are not only
different from every other diaper on the market but _different from one side
of the diaper to the other_ :fire:
I find them impressively infuriating.

BUT.

For _months_ (months 3 - 8 to be precise), they were the only diapers that
I would trust to not have a major :poop: leak when we left the house.
They are Hellish to put together, but their fit is worth gold for a few months :gem:

### Transition Diapers
There is an annoying stage when they are slightly too big for the majority of
newborn diapers but slightly too small for OS diapers (causing issues with
leaks), so there are a few brands of OS diapers that run small which are
perfect for this time.

In our case they were:
+ LighthouseKids Company Signature AIO (we still use these today quite happily)
+ Totsbots Easyfit Star AIO (another diaper we still use today)
+ Blumchen AIO
+ Tickle Tots AIOs
+ Baby Bare pockets
+ Close Pop-in AI2s (we dropped these as soon as we could)

We no longer use the last 3 on this list but _I have not sold them_ because they
were ***critical*** for the transition phase and I will use them again with
other kids (mine or family/friends').




## Things to Know
+ The amount of liquid your diapers will need to hold will not only change
as the baby grows up, but also with the seasons - babies need a lot more
absorbency in Winter than in Summer (because in Summer they release water in
other ways)
+ It is common for you to have to keep letting out rise snaps (increasing the
'height' of the diaper) until you find yourself with diapers at their biggest
by the time your baby is 8 or 9 months old - fear not! This doesn't mean they
are about to stop fitting. It's around this age that babies start moving more,
learning to pull to stand and eventually walking so their body shape changes
and they lean out. You'll often find that you may need to snap the rise back
up again in the near future as this happens.
+ Never iron your inserts or any diaper paraphenalia as this decreases absorption.
+ If your baby is teething, urine will smell a LOT stronger - always keep
this in mind before panicking something is wrong with your wash routine.
