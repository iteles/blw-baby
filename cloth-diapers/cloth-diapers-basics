## Cloth Diapers

There are many sections that need to be written up in this document, but I'll
start by writing up the critical sections required for basic knowledge
or those that I have a specific opinion about.

However, the plan is to include the following
+ Nomenclature (multiple languages)
+ [Types of Cloth Diapers](#types-of-cloth-diapers)
+ [Our Choices](#our-choices)
+ [Materials and Absorbency](materials-and-absorbency)
+ Things to Know
+ What causes leaks

## Types of Cloth Diapers

I don't want to go into all the different types of cloth diaper just yet as
there are actually a lot of decent resources online already on this, such as
https://www.thenappygurus.com/types-of-cloth-nappies.html

The whole of the [Nappy Gurus Help & Advice](https://www.thenappygurus.com/help.html)
section is extremely well put together and very helfpul if you're starting out.

I'm just leaving this diagram here as a reference point to discuss the
choices we have made (see below).

## Materials and Absorbency

Cloth diapers hinge on both their speed of and capacity for absorbency.

The only other thing to mention other than the table above is 'Charcoal Bamboo'.
This is actually not bamboo at all, it's just a fancy name for microfibre and
equally unhelpful.

### Absorbency capacity
The more capacity for absorbency, the more liquid a diaper will hold.

Having said this, every baby is different so whilst some can get away with
very little absorbency, others are considered 'medium to heavy wetters' and
will need a lot more absorbency, relying much more heavily on hemp inserts
(typically used in pocket diapers) or boosters (typically layered into other
types of diapers to increase absorbency).

### Absorbency speed
This is important for two reasons:
1. You need to layer your absorbency so that the layers closer to the baby
are the ones that absorb liquids the fastest - this will allow that layer to
absorb the liquids and wick them away to the lower layers which will have more
storage capacity.
2. If you have a baby who 'floods'; i.e. releases a large quantity of liquid
in a short time frame. Here you want the fastest possible absorption to wick
away the moisture so that you don't get leaks.

## Our Choices




## Things to Know
+ The amount of liquid your diapers will need to hold will not only change
as the baby grows up, but also with the seasons - babies need a lot more
absorbency in Winter than in Summer (because in Summer they release water in
other ways)
+ Never iron your inserts or any diaper paraphenalia as this decreases absorption.
