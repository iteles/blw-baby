## Cloth Diapers

There are many sections that need to be written up in this document, but I'll
start by writing up the critical sections required for basic knowledge
or those that I have a specific opinion about.

However, the plan is to include the following
+ Nomenclature (multiple languages)
+ [Types of Cloth Diapers](#types-of-cloth-diapers)
+ [Our Choices](#our-choices)
+ [Materials and Absorbency](#materials-and-absorbency)
+ Velcro vs Poppers
+ [Newborn vs One Size](#newborn-vs-one-size)
+ Things to Know
+ What causes leaks

## Types of Cloth Diapers

I don't want to go into all the different types of cloth diaper just yet as
there are actually a lot of decent resources online already on this, such as
https://www.thenappygurus.com/types-of-cloth-nappies.html

The whole of the [Nappy Gurus Help & Advice](https://www.thenappygurus.com/help.html)
section is extremely well put together and very helfpul if you're starting out.

I'm just leaving this diagram here as a reference point to discuss the
choices we have made (see below).

## Materials and Absorbency

<img width="664" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4185328/169095781-8c3c8f69-3ae5-4e04-ab39-780f198651a5.png">

Cloth diapers hinge on both their speed of and capacity for absorbency.

The only other thing to mention other than the table above is 'Charcoal Bamboo'.
This is actually not bamboo at all, it's just a fancy name for microfibre and
equally unhelpful.

### Absorbency capacity
The more capacity for absorbency, the more liquid a diaper will hold.

Having said this, every baby is different so whilst some can get away with
very little absorbency, others are considered 'medium to heavy wetters' and
will need a lot more absorbency, relying much more heavily on hemp inserts
(typically used in pocket diapers) or boosters (typically layered into other
types of diapers to increase absorbency).

### Absorbency speed
This is important for two reasons:
1. You need to layer your absorbency so that the layers closer to the baby
are the ones that absorb liquids the fastest - this will allow that layer to
absorb the liquids and wick them away to the lower layers which will have more
storage capacity.
2. If you have a baby who 'floods'; i.e. releases a large quantity of liquid
in a short time frame. Here you want the fastest possible absorption to wick
away the moisture so that you don't get leaks.

## Newborn vs One Size
There are 3 'sizes' of cloth diapers:
+ **Newborn**: These are extra small diapers that in some cases (not all) also
fit preemies. They have snaps that allow them to be resized to 2 or 3 different
sizes as well.
+ **One Size:** Often referred to as ***OS*** diapers, these are the typical
size of modern cloth diaper that will accompany a child throughout the
majority of their diaper journey. They are marketed as fitting babies from around
3-15kg (with a small amount of variation per brand) but usually don't fit
newborns because the leg holes are designed for slightly bigger babies.
+ **XL:** Nomenclature varies but these are often designated 'XL' or 'Super'
and are made for older toddlers but sizes vary widely. They could refer to
diapers that are 9 - 18kgs for example or even diapers that are 15 - 20kgs, so
it's important to review the stipulations of fit from the individual brand.

Ones size (OS) are by _far_ the most common, with many people deciding to
wait until their babies fit into this size before they start their cloth diaper
journey.

There _are_ 'newborn hacks' of folds that allow you to use OS diapers on smaller
babies but these are greatly dependent on the baby's body and on the diaper
brands.

## Our Choices




## Things to Know
+ The amount of liquid your diapers will need to hold will not only change
as the baby grows up, but also with the seasons - babies need a lot more
absorbency in Winter than in Summer (because in Summer they release water in
other ways)
+ Never iron your inserts or any diaper paraphenalia as this decreases absorption.
