# Wash routine

> The wash routine for cloth diapers is the **main source** of _every_ cloth diaper issue from smells to rashes to leaks.

The cloth diaper groups online are ***filled*** with people bemoaning issues with their cloth diapers that turn into nothing but 'let's trouble shoot your wash routine' posts.

***The problem is simple: there is a HUGE amount of misinformation out
there on what a wash routine should be***.

And yet, the basis of a good wash routine is _extremely_ simple.

## A Cloth Diaper Wash Routine - Start Here

Wash your diapers at the end of every 2-3 days.

### 1. Cold rinse, no detergent ('prewash')
Two important things to know here:
+ The key reason we're doing this step is to **rinse as much of the
human waste** out of those diapers as possible before actually washing them
  + We ***don't use detergent*** because we're not trying to clean them yet;
  the detergent is in the main wash and dosed appropriately for a
  heavily soiled load. If we start using detergent in prewashes we
  run the risk of ***detergent build-up*** (another common cloth diaper
    horror story)
+ I do this as a **completely separate wash** rather than just hitting the
'prewash'button on my machine. This is for two reasons:
  1. Many modern machines 'efficiently' don't drain the _full_ amount  of the
  prewash water out of the machine before starting the main wash. this is the
  _opposite_ of what we need - we want **all of that :poop: water drained**
  _before_ out main wash starts with clean water
  2. Using a separate wash often uses a bit more water and is a little longer
  than a 'prewash' which is what we want.

### 2. Hot main wash, full detergent, extra rinses
This is your main wash. It is a LONG cycle (often more than 3, even 4 hours)
but remember, you're cleaning full on human waster out of cloth.

**You want to have as much water as possible** in this wash so look up your
machine's instructions and figure out which program this is for you - often
it is the cotton program.
Yes, I understand this isn't as eco-friendly as the alternative but trust me
when I say a few more litres of water twice a week is much better than giving
up on cloth diapers altogether because your diapers aren't getting clean and
become a nightmare.

Key points:
+ Dose your detergent appropriately (see below)
+ Use the '**heavily soiled'** option on your machine
+ Add at least 2 **extra rinses** to your wash, more if you have them
+ Make sure your machine is **3 quarters full** so that you get the friction you need
to properly clean those diapers
  + If you don't have enough diapers in your load, bulk it out with clothing or
  small (hand) towels - *never use linens or large towels* because your diapers
  can get wrapped up in them and won't wash properly
+ Wash your diapers at the temperature indicated by manufacturers, this is
usually 40 degrees Celsius
  + Once a month we wash at 60 degrees C for maintenance

#### Dosing your detergent appropriately
1. Powder detergent rinses off your diapers more easily than liquid detergent
so ideally, **use powder**.
2. Use 'real' detergent, not baby detergent or for sensitive skin as these do not
wash as efficiently.
3. Your detergent **must not have more than 5% soap content**
4. Use the dose of detergent recommended for the total kilos of your machine,
not the estimated amount of kilos in your diaper load (which remember, should
  be 3 quarters of your machine anyway)
5. Use the dose of detergent recommended for **heavily soiled** clothing (which
  is an additional amount over the amount recommended for your machine size)
6. Add the powder directly to the drum to get the most out of it and
prevent gumming up your machine's tubes.

Yes, this seems like a lot. But if you have the right programs and rinses in
place, it's the best way to get those diapers clean.

### 3. Final hot rinse, no detergent

This should be 30 - 60 minutes long and be at the **same temperature as your
main wash**.

***This is just a rinse cycle, you don't want to add any more detergent here***.

Again I would recommend doing this as a **separate cycle** so that you get a
good long rinse rather than a short one tacked onto the end of your main
program. We use the same program for the final rinse as we do for the prewash,
we just make sure we change the temperature.

**Your diapers shouldn't smell of anything** (not even laundry detergent,
  except sometimes a little faintly) when you get to the end of this routine!


## OUR Wash Routine

We tend to wash at the end of every 3rd day, or at the end of every 2nd in the
hot Summer to prevent smells.
If we're washing more often (end of every second day) I always make sure I have
small towels on hand to bulk out the load so it's 3 quarters full.

These are the programs and steps for our LG washing machine, in a _soft_ water area.

### 1. Cold rinse, no detergent

Machine steps:
+ Algodão (cotton)
+ Turbowash (quickwash version of the program selected above)
+ Bring temperature down to Zero

### 2. Hot main wash, full detergent, extra rinses

// Detergent quantities go here.

Machine steps:
+ Algodão (cotton)
+ Soil level: heavy (max)
+ 40 degrees (60 once a month as needed)
+ Extra rinse x 2


### 1. Hot rinse, no detergent

Machine steps:
+ Algodão (cotton)
+ Turbowash (quickwash version of the program selected above)


<!-- They depend on:
+ The hardness of your water
+ The detergent that you use, both type and quantity
  + This is _different_ for _every single_ detergent (thanks manufacturers)
  + There are a number of detergents that shouldn't be used full stop (anything with more than 5% soap will clog up the diaper fibers and anything eco and 'sensitive' will not be very effective as a general rule)
+ Your washing machine
  + Whether it weighs your clothes
  + Whether it's 'eco'
  + Whether you can find a combination of programs that put in enough water and do enough rinsing for a good clean - we're talking about human waste after all
  + Top loading or front loading
+ The number of days you leave between washes
+ How full your wash load is
+ Your ability to trouble shoot when you first have an issue and adapt
+ If the wrong products are used (detergents with more than 5% soap, harsh chemicals or fabric softeners) your diapers can be irreparably ruined or require a very Laborious process to 'revive'. -->
